						<h2 style="margin-top:0;">Our framework</h2>
						<p>Each of the 16 Personality types consists of four letters. Each letter corresponds to a
							fundamental personality trait for that personality type, which is found by answering a set
							of tailored questions. Your answers to those questions determine your combination of four
							sets of opposing traits—introverted versus extroverted, sensing versus intuitive, thinking
							versus feeling, and perceiving versus judging.</p>
						<p>INTPs are relatively rare, especially among women. INTPs compose around 5% of all men, and 2%
							of all women, which adds up to around 3% of the population.</p>
						<div id="meaning-sc">
							<h2>What is the meaning of INTP?</h2>
							<p>INTPs (Architects) are reserved, pensive, and analytical problem-solvers who seek to
								understand the underlying principles of how things work. Creative and open-minded,
								Architects embrace innovation and welcome fresh perspectives. As quiet as they are, they
								often surprise people with their endless curiosity and unconventional way of looking at
								life.</p>
							<p>Oftentimes, INTPs seem detached from their surroundings, as they spend much of their time
								lost in thought. Their active, sharp minds are constantly picking up and processing new
								information, which often causes them to postpone making decisions. In fact, they are
								prone to second-guessing themselves and avoid committing to a decision before seeing the
								full picture.</p>
							<p>Although INTPs are rather private and come off as aloof, they’re usually happy to engage
								in intellectual discussions, especially philosophical or scientific in nature. However,
								they rarely, if ever, share details about their personal lives—even with their closest
								friends. After all, they are fascinated by abstract ideas and theories and prefer to
								remain objective at all times.</p>
						</div>

						<div id="ntp-main">
							<h2>INTP characteristics</h2>
							<h3 id="common-main">Common strengths</h3>
							<h4 id="Open-minded">Open-minded</h4>
							<p>Architects love to explore new ideas and possibilities. This allows them to utilize their
								knowledge and intellect to help them see what others think regarding specific issues and
								concepts. Because their immense quest to acquire as much knowledge as possible is rarely
								quenched, most Architects spend their whole lives learning and acquiring as much
								knowledge as possible.</p>
							<p>For an INTP, it's crucial that any new theories are supported by logical and well-framed
								arguments. This ties with their analytical side, which strives to pursue understanding,
								truth, and objectivity. This relentless pursuit can often be their driving force, and
								many INTPs love to identify errors to eliminate data.</p>
							<p>Architects are also open-minded, which helps them achieve this pursuit. When it comes to
								exploring their options and learning, INTPs like looking at ideas from a fresh
								perspective. They often dislike feeling 'stuck' and the need to focus on concepts and
								theories which have already been proven. Due to this, many INTPs excel in the science
								field as they love to discover ideas and cross boundaries in their pursuit of knowledge
								acquisition. Architects dislike following rules and are fully prepared to keep their
								minds open to ideas others may deem impossible.</p>
							<h4 id="Analytical">Analytical and problem-solvers</h4>
							<p>INTPs are also known as 'Abstract Philosophers' as they're great thinkers and like to
								problem solve across various areas of their lives. For an INTP, the world is a complex
								system with aspects of interconnection needed to be understood. A Architect will often
								try to find a deeper understanding and meaning behind things that happen to them and
								events occurring in their daily lives. From this, they'll come up with logical
								explanations and conclusions.</p>
							<p>While INTPs love to think about various concepts and topics often, outsiders might
								overlook this as not much is publicly revealed. They are frequently misunderstood as
								overly introverted; however, many INTPs will be quietly thinking away behind this
								exterior.</p>
							<p>As the name implies, Architects are highly logical individuals and fast thinking.
								Individuals who have this personality type like to observe and analyze connections
								between points and concepts to discover explanations to common problems. This allows
								them to effectively problem-solve since their minds are inclined towards the analysis of
								information. INTPs also love to approach new possibilities from new angles, which gives
								them unique perspectives others may struggle to grasp.</p>
							<p>INTPs often enjoy being placed in situations involving solving puzzles, riddles, or
								games. In this environment, INTPs can thrive and showcase their natural talent to
								others. While this skill certainly is impressive, being analytical and good at
								problem-solving is a trait that usually comes naturally for them, and as such, INTPs may
								give little thought to it.</p>
							<div class="intp-btn"><a href="#" class="btn">Discover more about INTP personality type!</a>
							</div>
							<h4 id="creative">Unconventional creativity</h4>
							<p>Architects love unusual approaches to solutions and creative ideas. They like to solve
								problems in clever and unique ways, successfully thinking outside the box. INTPs prefer
								to contemplate the theory behind the idea rather than simply accepting the way it is.
								Understanding and explaining complex ideas and how they can be improved is second nature
								to Architects.</p>
							<p>Most INTPs are naturally highly creative and can apply this skill to many situations.
								While they're often misclassified as logical and analytical, they also have a great
								imagination and creative drive. INTPs love spending time alone to recharge and explore
								the many possibilities within their minds. Their inner world is often incredibly vast
								and filled with exciting new ideas and thoughts they want to bring to life.</p>
							<p>Due to this, many INTPS find themselves drawn to more artistic careers that incorporate
								music, drawing, dance, or writing. They're incredibly interested in jobs and careers
								that help them express creativity through various forms. For most Architects, being in
								an environment that suppresses their naturally imaginative thoughts can be highly
								detrimental to their happiness.</p>
							<p>INTPs excel in environments that allow room for growth and ways that help them feel
								challenged and interested. It's easy for them to lose interest in people or ideas that
								aren't challenging them or bringing passion. While Architects are usually very
								scientific, incorporating a more artistic side to their personality might seem like an
								odd merging of interests, but this allows INTP to uniquely accomplish many impressive
								things.</p>
							<h4 id="passionate">Passionate</h4>
							<p>While many INTPs are often viewed as outwardly rigid, private, withdrawn, and
								introverted, this is not necessarily the case when they're interested in a challenging,
								or intriguing topic. If you involve a Architect in a conversation or discussion that
								they are interested in, they'll be able to become incredibly vivid and entertaining.
								INTPs are also more likely to use their wit and humor around people they trust. They
								also love to bounce ideas off their companions.</p>
							<p>Another great aspect of INTPs is their aspect of being blunt when needed. They generally
								hate beating around the bush, and when they have something to say, they believe telling
								the truth is better than avoiding it, even at the expense of a potential disagreement.
							</p>
							<p>INTPs often make great guests, especially in a smaller group. However, they can struggle
								with people they don’t know. Most INTPs don't like overly large gatherings with loud
								music and lots of strangers, preferring quality conversations and good company over
								excess. In this situation, INTPs can be very enthusiastic, passionate, and playful with
								a creative humour.</p>
							<h3 id="Common-weaknesses">Common weaknesses</h3>
							<h4 id="Impatient">Impatient</h4>
							<p>Many INTPs can struggle with being patient, especially around others who don't comprehend
								information or ideas as fast as them. While most Architects love to share their
								knowledge with others, if the individual does not immediately understand what they are
								trying to explain, the INTP can often become upset and impatient and would instead end
								the conversation than explain further.</p>
							<p>Many INTPs often get frustrated with professions like teaching and tend to bottle up
								their discomfort, which isn't great for either party. INTPs tend to think everyone has
								the same problem-solving and analytical abilities as they do, rather than understand
								their individual strengths. This lack of adaptability is something INTPs need to work on
								to improve their interpersonal relationships.</p>
							<h4 id="Insensitive">Insensitive</h4>
							<p>Architects are often classified as unemotional or insensitive, especially in times of
								conflict. With INTPs, emotions are void from problem-solving or understanding core
								reasons behind issues, so these feelings are often dismissed. This might be offensive
								for those from a "feeling" type personality, resulting in emotional distancing or an
								ending of a relationship.</p>
							<p>While Architects don't mean to be rude or unfriendly, their intelligence and analytical
								reasoning skills can make them appear arrogant to others. They often take pride in
								knowing a lot of information and don't hesitate to explain concepts to others, which can
								be frustrating. In discussions, many INTPs can find themselves (unknowingly or
								knowingly) looking down on others who have a viewpoint different from them and
								dismissing ideas they deem 'wrong.' This can make them appear snobbish and stand-offish
								if left uncontrolled.</p>
							<p>Architects can also prioritize knowledge and the pursuit of education over other people
								and their emotions. It's easy for them to become absorbed in their own needs and ideas,
								and this focus on logic while neglecting others can be highly offensive to their loved
								ones.</p>
							<h4 id="Extremely-private">Extremely private</h4>
							<p>Most Architects are incredibly private people, preferring to live in their own world
								filled with ideas, beliefs, and thoughts over real life. While many do allow a select
								few loved ones to have small glimpses into what's happening in their minds, this is an
								often rare occasion.</p>
							<p>INTPs usually have a small circle of trusted close friends over large friendship groups.
								However, discussions with these friends usually don't result in the INTP overly
								expressing themselves and their emotions. For an INTP, their own inner thought processes
								can be so demanding that they are often lost in them, even in company. When others
								notice, this can lead to conflict.</p>
							<h4 id="Indecisive">Indecisive</h4>
							<p>While Architects are intelligent and analytical, they are often afraid of criticism and
								failure. INTPs looking to discover a new concept frequently worry that they have
								overlooked an important problem with their theory or idea. This can result in extreme
								indecisiveness, procrastination, and self-consciousness about wasting resources.</p>
							<p>Architects also have high expectations of themselves and the work they produce. Their
								constant pursuit of perfection and constant analysis throughout the working process can
								cause delays in decisions, resulting in inconclusive claims. INTPs also find it hard to
								accept things as they are and constantly see ways of improvement. Even if they achieve
								exemplary results, their behavior can still result in dissatisfaction and a deep desire
								to change their inventions. This can make INTPs even more withdrawn, as, in their quest
								for improvement, they forget to take into account current needs.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="interests-ntp">
							<h2 id="special-interests">What are the special interests of INTPs?</h2>
							<p>INTPs are considered one of the more dreamy, thoughtful, and imaginative personality
								types, with a strong interest in scientific discovery. A typical INTP is incredibly
								innovative, intelligent, logical, and insightful, and loves to uncover complex puzzles.
							</p>
							<p>Most INTPs have a wide range of hobbies and like exploring various new things as they
								have an interest in so many different subjects. Learning and growing are important to
								INTPs, and they always want to try out things that improve their education and
								experience. INTPs can also find themselves becoming bored quickly, so they need
								activities that can challenge them intellectually. Don't be surprised if an INTP bounces
								from one hobby to the next, as they'll want to learn as much as possible.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Learning languages</li>
								<li>Exercise classes</li>
								<li>Reading and research</li>
								<li>Gaming or other computer-based activities</li>
								<li>Strategy based games such as chess</li>
								<li>Art and cultural events</li>
								<li>Arts and crafts</li>
								<li>Puzzles and board games</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div id="Interacting-ntp">
							<h2 id="Interacting-wrap">Interacting with INTPs</h2>
							<h3 id="relationship-wrap">In a relationship</h3>
							<p>INTPs are generally easy to get along with in a relationship and don't make demands on
								their partner. INTPs are considered aloof and introverted in social situations, but when
								they're comfortable with their partner, a Architect can showcase lots of enthusiasm in
								sharing ideas and thoughts. They also dislike emotional demands or manipulation and
								would rather have a partner that communicates honestly and directly.</p>
							<h3 id="ntp-need">What does an INTP need in a relationship?</h3>
							<p>Most INTPs dislike games and drama in relationships. They thrive off a partner that is
								straightforward and able to understand their needs for alone time and analytical
								behavior. INTPs like partners who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about similar
								hobbies and interests, and allow them the freedom to get space to withdraw within their
								thoughts once in a while.</p>
							<p>An INTP highly values intellect and engaging discussions with their partner. While all
								conversations don't need to be incredibly thought-provoking, INTPs dislike 'fake' or
								superficial small talk with those they are close to. Many INTPs are also highly
								suspicious and find it hard to read between the lines with flirting or teasing. They are
								much more comfortable with partners who are honest and have no interest in games.</p>
							<p>If their partner is an intellectual match, many INTPs will love to have debates and
								heated discussions, particularly if they can take criticism and dish it out. However,
								emotional displays of affection can be hard for them, which can cause some conflict if a
								compromise is not reached.</p>
							<h4 id="relationship-ntp">An ideal relationship for INTPs</h4>
							<p>An ideal relationship for the INTP has to live up to some of the relationships they tend
								to idealize or build up in their imagination. Some components needed to satisfy an INTP
								include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>A partner who is patient and understanding</li>
								<li>The freedom to get time and space away</li>
								<li>A partner who is emotionally strong and dislikes playing games</li>
								<li>An honest and straightforward partner</li>
								<li>An intellectual equal who likes to discuss ideas and theories</li>
							</ul>
							<h4 id="compatibility">Relationship compatibility</h4>
							<p>While any personality type can be compatible with INTP, some may be more suited to
								balance out INTPs specific traits. They are most compatible with people who are also
								logical but also extroverted enough to balance the INTPs Introversion.</p>
							<p>For INTPs, the ENTJ personality type can be a great match, as this pair has a relatively
								similar style of communication and can understand the other's needs on an intellectual
								level. Both ENTJ and INTP like to avoid superficial topics and small talk and love
								engaging and stimulating conversations across a wide range of topics.</p>
							<div class="intp-btn"><a href="#" class="btn">Find out who you're compatible with!</a></div>
							<h4 id="As-parent">As a parent</h4>
							<p>As parents, INTPs are devoted and committed to teaching their children. They view
								parenthood as a challenge and another way for them to learn and acquire knowledge. INTPs
								will view their children as independent individuals even when young, with personality
								traits that need guidance and direction.</p>
							<p>Since Architects value intellect and independence, they will often guide their children
								to pursue education and knowledge, ask questions, think independently, and not settle
								for mediocre things. As the children grow older, INTPs will respect their personal views
								and opinions even if it can differ from their own.</p>
							<p>As parents, INTPs are generally flexible and open-minded, not wanting to put too much
								pressure on their children and their daily obligations. They themselves do not like
								routine and regime, so they'll often have a looser structure and schedule than other
								parent personality types. However, this can backfire, because if their partner is not
								someone that likes to discipline children, they might live in an unlimited environment
								with a lack of rules and discipline.</p>
							<p>INTPs must also be aware of their emotional numbness, as getting in tune with their
								children's emotions is crucial for being an understanding parent. INTPs may struggle to
								master this area, but doing this is vital for getting closer to their children. While
								this process might require a lot of hard work and persistence, having involved parents
								is essential for the health of an INTP’s children.</p>
							<h4 id="As-friend">As a friend</h4>
							<p>INTP's social circle is relatively small and limited to a trusted few. With these few
								people, INTPs love to share their inner feelings and thoughts. These close friendships
								often involve common interests based on shared passions and philosophical conversations.
							</p>
							<p>When they're comfortable among their friends, INTPs like to dominate discussions and have
								no trouble contributing to the conversation with their witty comments, unique ideas,
								observations, and friendly demeanor.</p>
							<p>INTPs strongly dislike conflicts, and when one arises, they are more likely to excuse
								themselves and leave the conversation rather than talk it out. If talking it out is
								required, an INTP will prefer to find logical explanations over taking emotions into
								account. Due to this, personality types with strong 'sensing' or 'feeling' traits are
								not often found in the INTP friend list due to their dislike of abstract ideas and
								emotion-rich outlook.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="personality-growth">
							<h2>INTP personality growth tips</h2>
							<p>To turn their weaknesses into strengths, INTPs should:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Don’t wait for inspiration.</strong> INTPs often struggle to finish what
									they start. Instead of waiting for motivation or inspiration, they should push
									themselves to achieve their goals and learn to work consistently.</li>
								<li><strong>Let others in.</strong> Since INTPs can be rather closed off, they should
									consciously choose to open up to others to improve their relationships.</li>
								<li><strong>Act.</strong> Unlike most people, Architects don’t need to think twice
									before they act—they’re already thinking more than enough! Since overthinking often
									leads them to procrastination, they might benefit from simply taking action instead.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Embrace emotions.</strong> Although INTPs experience emotions deeply, they’re
								often unaware of them. Learning to recognize and understand their own feelings can help
								them navigate interpersonal relationships and relate to others.</p>
